# üß© Components

Here's a breakdown of the key components in this dotfiles setup:

- **Hyprland:** A dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that doesn't sacrifice on its looks.

# üíé Hyprland

Hyprland is the heart of this setup, providing a smooth and visually appealing desktop environment. Configuration is split into several files under `@hypr/UserConfigs/` for better organization.
Some noteworthy configuration files are:

- `@hypr/hyprland.conf`: main Hyprland configuration file.
- `@hypr/UserConfigs/Keybinds.conf`: Keybindings for Hyprland
- `@hypr/UserConfigs/Animations.conf`: Animations used in hyprland.
- `@hypr/UserConfigs/Monitors.conf`: Configures monitors.

Here are some of the most used keybinds you can find in `@hypr/UserConfigs/Keybinds.conf`:

```sh
#Move window with arrow keys
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, left, movewindow, l
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, right, movewindow, r
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, up, movewindow, u
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, down, movewindow, d

#Switch between windows with arrow keys
bind = $mainMod, left, movefocus, l
bind = $mainMod, right, movefocus, r
bind = $mainMod, up, movefocus, u
bind = $mainMod, down, movefocus, d

#Switch to specific workspace
bind = $mainMod, 1, workspace, 1
bind = $mainMod, 2, workspace, 2
bind = $mainMod, 3, workspace, 3
bind = $mainMod, 4, workspace, 4
bind = $mainMod, 5, workspace, 5
bind = $mainMod, 6, workspace, 6
bind = $mainMod, 7, workspace, 7
bind = $mainMod, 8, workspace, 8
```

- `@fish/config.fish`: Main configuration file for Fish, including aliases, environment variables, and custom functions.
- `@fish/functions/`: Directory containing custom Fish functions.
- `@fish/fish_plugins`: Contains list of used plugins. Using [Tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide) prompt

# üí§ Nvim

Neovim is configured with [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).

- `@nvim/init.lua`: Loads LazyVim and custom plugins.
- `@nvim/lua/config/`: Directory containing configuration files for LazyVim, keymaps, autocommands, and options.
- `@nvim/lua/plugins/`: Custom plugins for Nvim.

# ‚¨áÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before installing the dotfiles, ensure that you have the following packages and programs installed on your system. Installation commands are provided for common distributions:

## üì¶ Install Required Packages

<details>
<summary><strong>üß™ Arch Linux / Manjaro</strong></summary>

```bash
sudo pacman -S hyprland waybar kitty fish neovim wofi pamixer brightnessctl slurp swappy
```

> For `wlogout`, install via AUR:

```bash
yay -S wlogout
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üêß Debian / Ubuntu</strong></summary>

```bash
sudo apt install hyprland waybar kitty fish neovim wofi pamixer brightnessctl slurp swappy wlogout
```

> Make sure your system supports Wayland and has proper repositories for Hyprland.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üé© Fedora</strong></summary>

```bash
sudo dnf install hyprland waybar kitty fish neovim wofi pamixer brightnessctl slurp swappy wlogout
```

</details>

# üíæ Installation

**Important: Before proceeding, back up your existing configuration files!** This ensures you can easily revert to your previous settings if needed.

1.  **Backup Your Current Configuration:**

    Before applying these dotfiles, create backups of your existing configurations. This is crucial! Here are some common locations to back up:

    - Hyprland: `~/.config/hypr`
    - Waybar: `~/.config/waybar`
    - Kitty: `~/.config/kitty`
    - Fish: `~/.config/fish`
    - Nvim: `~/.config/nvim`

    Use the following commands to create backups (replace `hypr`, `waybar`, etc. with the appropriate directory names):

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/.config_backup # If you don't already have a backup directory
    cp -r ~/.config/hypr ~/.config_backup/
    cp -r ~/.config/waybar ~/.config_backup/
    cp -r ~/.config/kitty ~/.config_backup/
    cp -r ~/.config/fish ~/.config_backup/
    cp -r ~/.config/nvim ~/.config_backup/
    ```

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

3.  **Identify Your Monitor Names:**

    Hyprland requires you to specify the names of your monitors in the configuration. To find the correct names, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    hyprctl monitors | grep -E "Monitor|description"
    ```

    This will output information about your connected monitors. Look for the `name` field for each monitor. For example:

    ```
    1) eDP-1 (1920x1080@60.00Hz) at 0x0
    2) HDMI-A-1 (1920x1080@60.00Hz) at 1920x0
    ```

    In this case, the monitor names are `eDP-1` and `HDMI-A-1`. **Write these down, as you'll need them in the next step!**

4.  **Manually Copy Configuration Files:**

    Carefully copy the configuration files from the cloned repository to their respective locations in your home directory. For example:

    - **Hyprland:**

      ```shell
      cp -r ~/.dotfiles/hypr/* ~/.config/hypr/
      ```

      **Important:** Edit the `@hypr/UserConfigs/Monitors.conf` file and replace the example monitor names with the actual names you found in the previous step! This is crucial for your setup to work correctly.

    - **Waybar:**

      ```shell
      cp -r ~/.dotfiles/waybar/* ~/.config/waybar/
      ```

    - **Kitty:**

      ```shell
      cp -r ~/.dotfiles/kitty/* ~/.config/kitty/
      ```

    - **Fish:**

      ```shell
      cp -r ~/.dotfiles/fish/* ~/.config/fish/
      ```

    - **Nvim:**
      ```shell
      cp -r ~/.dotfiles/nvim/* ~/.config/nvim/
      ```

    **Important:** If you encounter files with the same name, carefully review both files and decide whether to replace the existing file, merge the contents, or skip the file.

5.  **Reload/Restart:**

    After copying the files, you'll need to reload or restart the applications for the changes to take effect:

    - **Hyprland:** Restart Hyprland to apply the new configuration.
    - **Waybar:** You can either restart Waybar or send it a reload signal (`pkill -SIGRTMIN+8 waybar`). There's also a reload script located in `@hypr/UserConfigs/scripts/reload_waybar`
    - **Kitty:** Kitty should automatically reload the configuration, but you can restart it if needed.
    - **Fish:** Start a new Fish shell session, or source the config file (`source ~/.config/fish/config.fish`).
    - **Nvim:** Open nvim and run `:source ~/.config/nvim/init.lua`
